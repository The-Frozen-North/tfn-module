Lith My'athar is one of the very few safe bastions in the Underdark, and it is likely that the Valsharess and her allies will take their conquest to the surface after their destruction. \n\nThe Seer believes you are the only one capable of stopping the Valsharess and her massive army. She has requested your aid in weakening the Valsharess and her allies. The Valsharess is currently allied with both the beholders and the mindflayers. Severing their alliance would weaken the Valsharess significantly.\n\nTo stand against her army, the Seer and the drow rebels of Lith My'athar will need to acquire some allies. There are rumours of a nearby island inhabited entirely of golems. If these golems can be controlled, they can bolster the forces of Lith My'athar."

Luskan, a sworn enemy of Neverwinter, had caught wind of it and are making preparations to attack Neverwinter in it's weakened state.\n\nNasher has given you orders to seek out Aarin Gend, who was sent on a mission to infiltrate Luskan. After consulting with him, the plan is to assassinate all of the High Captains in Luskan, which should stop the Luskan war in it's tracks.\n\nHowever, getting inside the city will not be easy. It is currently in lockdown and impossible to enter the normal way. Aarin has told you of an alternative path - an entrance to the abandoned mines which may have a connection to the Luskan sewers. The mines themselves appear to be infested with umber hulks, though.\n\nMoving through the city may prove to be another hurdle. Aarin described some sort of magical attunement that the Arcane Brotherhood has casted which allows wardens in the city to easily distinguish intruders. These wardens should be avoided at all costs as Aarin warns, or the might of the Luskan army may be brought onto you immediately."

It couldn't be cured by normal means, and the holiest of clerics found their divine healing useless. To fortify the city and aid in investigating the plague, Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande called for all adventurers of promise to attend the Neverwinter Academy. \n\nYou are one of the adventurers who have answered that call. After restoring order to the districts of Neverwinter, some of the chaos seems to have subsided. You have returned with Aribeth, who was suspicious of Meldanen's claim that the Helmites were the cause, which turned out to be true. \n\nAfter investigatng the Temple of Helm, you have slain the leader and retrieved a vial labeled \"PLAGUE-66\". When you returned to Aribeth with this information, she revealed that she received a scroll that was able to divine the reagents needed for a cure from the sample, which you have gathered and returned to Aribeth. Desther stole these, but you have managed to retrieve them and return them to Aribeth. The cure is now in our possession.\n\nAribeth has suggested that you speak with Lord Nasher himself for further tasks, who has asked for you personally."
