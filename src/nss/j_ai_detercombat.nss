///////////////////////// [Execute Combat Action] //////////////////////////////
    Fired from other scripts, this runs an actual actions.

    It also contains the Pre-combat and Post-combat action events. In essense
    they therefore fire if they percieve a target, or a new round, or maybe
    a spell cast at - any combat action.

    Therefore, they only fire if the default AI is being used :-)

    Do NOT mess with this file, please. :-D
///////////////////////// [History] ////////////////////////////////////////////
    1.3 - AI Include only fired from here. This script is executed from others,
          as the default in place of custom AI scripts.
    1.4 - Mainly See the generic AI include file for changes. This is just
          what calls DetermineCombatRound() and associated things.
///////////////////////// [Workings] ///////////////////////////////////////////
    This is simple:

    - We execute it if there is no other AI files.
    - We use a stored target for things like "On Percieve, attack seen", so
      we react as normal.

    If there is a custom AI file specified, this won't fire.

    It cleans things up, and is the only script in the whole set that has
    j_inc_generic_ai in, reducing file size, and compile times. AI is more
    manageable too!
